# Inaccessible Recipe List Template Site

A plausible modern site, built with HTML and CSS, meant to contain a bunch of common accessibility defects.

This template is built from [HTML.Design's Recipelist template](https://html.design/download/recipelist-food-template/), but with changes here and there to make the template less accessible.
